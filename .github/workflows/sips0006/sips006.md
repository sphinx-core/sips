## Introduction

**$SPX** is the native cryptocurrency of the SPHINX blockchain ecosystem, designed to fuel decentralized applications, quantum-secure, smart contracts, and digital asset exchanges. This outline the structure of the total supply, distribution, and coin's management. This model is designed to ensure long-term sustainability, reward ecosystem participants, and provide transparency for the community.

**$SPX** is a product, **NOT a security or investment offering**, it is simply a coins useful for paying transaction fees or building or purchasing decentralized application services on the SPHINX platform; 

> ### **It does not give you voting rights over anything, and we make no guarantees of its future value.**


This document outlines the breakdown of the coinomics, covering all critical areas, from development cost structures to strategic coins distributions aimed at sustaining the project's growth over the coming years. With a transparent and well-structured approach, aims to build a thriving ecosystem that benefits all stakeholders while ensuring its long-term success and value appreciation.


## Overview

We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the community, especially to those individuals who have dedicated countless hours, even at great personal sacrifice, to bring the SHINX project to life. The patience and commitment shown by those close to the project, particularly those who have been awaiting the launch of the **$SPX**, have been truly extraordinary. We acknowledge that the launch has taken longer than anticipated, and we recognize the challenges and frustrations that have come with it. Navigating legal complexities and establishing the necessary technical infrastructure have been far more intricate than originally foreseen.

Over the **last 5 months**, we have made substantial progress in implementing Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) solutions, ensuring the security and resilience of the network against the potential threats of quantum computing. This milestone marks an important step in the future-proofing of the SPHINX blockchain.

During this time, we have made significant strides in the development of the SPHINX blockchain, and we would like to share some key milestones that have shaped the project: 

1. For project implementation see the progress here: **[Blockchain package](https://github.com/sphinx-core/go)**
2. For proposals implementation see the progress here: **[SIPS](https://github.com/sphinx-core/sips)**

Despite the setbacks, we remain focused on the long-term vision for the SPHINX blockchain. The road to launch has not been easy, but we are now confident that we have built a solid foundation to support the growth of the ecosystem.

### 3. Development Allocation

- **Total Modules**: 3,000 modules required for project development.  
- **Development Over 2 Years**: The first **2,000 modules** to be completed over 2 years.  
- **Total SPX for Development**: 30,000,000 SPX  

**SPX per Module:**

```math
30,000,000 \text{ SPX} \div 3,000 \text{ modules} = 10,000 \text{ SPX/module}
```

**Total Required SPX for First 2 Years (2,000 modules):**

```math
10,000 \text{ SPX/module} \times 2,000 = 20,000,000 \text{ SPX} \text{ (for the first 2 years)}
```
> **After the first 2 years, development costs for additional modules will decrease due to the increasing value of **$SPX**.**



### 4. Founder and Co-founder Allocation Model

**Founder Allocation:**
- **SPX Allocation**: 10,000,000  
- **USD Value**: $600,000  
- **Distribution Model**: Vesting over 3 years (e.g., 25% per year or 6.25% per quarter). Vesting unlocks every quarter or on milestones tied to the project's progress.

**Co-founder Allocation:**
- **SPX Allocation**: 7,000,000  
- **USD Value**: $420,000  
- **Distribution Model**: Similar vesting structure as the founder (3 years, quarterly unlocks).


### 5. Contributors (Legal, Chief Security, Advisors, Partners) Allocation & Distribution Model

- **Total SPX Allocation**: 20,000,000  
- **USD Value**: $1.200,000  
- **Distribution Model**: Split across the total of contributors based on their role and impact (e.g., angel investors may receive more). Can be structured as either milestone-based or vesting.

### 6. SPHINX Foundation Allocations

- **SPX Allocation**: 20,000,000  
- **USD Value**: $1,200,000  
- **Role**: Manage the long-term sustainability of the ecosystem, fund new initiatives, R&D, and unforeseen expenses. The foundation will also support new partnerships or coin buybacks if needed.


## Strategy for Sustaining Operations

As the price of $SPX increases, we can adjust the allocation and sale of coins over the next year. Here’s how the sales will support the project, with increasing coin prices over time.


### 1. Price Over Time

- **First 3 months** (Price = $0.06): Coins will be sold at a low price to cover initial operational costs and development expenses.
- **Next 4 months** (Price = $0.24): The price increases as the project progresses, helping raise more funds with less coin issuance.
- **Final 5 months** (Price = $0.528): The price reaches a higher point as the ecosystem matures, maximizing allocation from coin sales.

### 2. Breakdown of Coins Sales and Needs

| Period           | Amount Raised | SPX to Sell      | Price per SPX | Key Categories for Sales                            | Allocation Strategy                                                                 |
|------------------|---------------|------------------|---------------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **First 3 Months**| $1,200,000    | 20,000,000 SPX   | $0.06         | Engineers (Development), Founder, Co-founder, Contributors (Legal, Advisors, Partners) | Focus on funding development (2000 modules). Sell from Engineer allocation (20M SPX), limited sales from Founder (10% of 10M = 1M SPX), Co-founder (10% of 7M = 700K SPX). Contributions are milestone-based or vested, so only a small amount will be sold from this allocation in the first 3 months. |
| **Next 4 Months**| $3,600,000    | 15,000,000 SPX   | $0.24         | Campaigns, Contributors (Legal, Advisors, Chief Security, Partners, Community Managers) | Focus on expanding the community and marketing. Sell from Community Managers (5M SPX) and Campaigns (8M SPX). Contributors can begin selling depending on milestones or vesting schedules. |
| **Final 5 Months**| $13,200,000   | 25,000,000 SPX   | $0.528        | Engineers (Development), Founder, Co-founder, Contributors (Legal, Advisors, Chief Security, Partners, Community Managers) | Continue development and ecosystem growth. Sell from Engineers (remaining coins as needed for further development), and SPHINX Foundation allocation to support the project’s sustainability. Contributors' sales based on milestones and vesting terms. |

### 3.Total Breakdown

- **Total SPX to be Sold**: 60,000,000
- **Total Raised from Issuance**: $18,000,000


### 4. Sustainability and Survival Plan

The $SPX Coin Sale is structured to ensure long-term sustainability and project survival. By offering 60,000,000 SPX over 12 months, we aim to raise $18,000,000 through three phases of coin sales.

**First 3 months (Price = .06):**

In the first period, we will sell 20,000,000 SPX to raise $1,200,000. These funds will cover initial operational costs and the development of 2000 modules. The funds raised will be allocated primarily towards development (including engineers, founders, and contributors). This low price ensures that enough funds are available for the project's startup phase while keeping the coin issuance low.

**Next 4 months (Price = .24):**

In the second phase, we will sell 15,000,000 SPX for $3,600,000. The price increase will help us raise more funds with fewer coins. This phase is critical for expanding the community, marketing, and securing partnerships, as well as for rewarding the community managers, campaigns, and contributors. The rise in price will also ensure that less SPX is needed for a more significant impact on the project.

**Final 5 months (Price = .528):**

In the final phase, we will sell 25,000,000 SPX to raise $13,200,000. The price increase further optimizes the remaining supply to fund development and the SPHINX Foundation's sustainability efforts. The project's ecosystem will have matured, so the funds raised in this final phase will support continued development and help build a sustainable and profitable environment for the SPX ecosystem.


### 5. Distributed Campaigns and Airdrop Model

**Campaign Allocations**:
8,000,000 $SPX will be allocated towards **distributed campaigns** and **community engagement** efforts. These funds will be used to run various activities aimed at expanding the project's visibility, increasing adoption, and forming key partnerships. This includes:

- **Partnerships**: Collaborations with influencers, content creators, and other blockchain projects to drive engagement.
- **Marketing Campaigns**: Run digital and offline campaigns targeting specific user groups and promoting **$SPX**.
- **Community Outreach**: Organize events such as meetups, webinars, and hackathons to engage with the community and expand the user base.

### 6. Community Airdrop:
5,000,000 $SPX will be reserved for **airdrop campaigns** aimed at encouraging early adoption, user engagement, and promoting the **$SPX** ecosystem. Airdrops will be carried out with the following goals:

- **User Engagement**: Rewarding users who participate in specific actions like signing up for the newsletter, participating in surveys, or following social media channels.
- **Incentivizing Holders**: Reward loyal users by distributing a portion of the airdropped coins based on their commitment to holding the coins long term.
- **Building Community Awareness**: Distribute coins to a wider audience to create awareness and increase the coin’s presence in the market.

These **distributed campaigns** and **airdrop** strategies are critical for increasing the **$SPX** coin’s exposure, driving early user engagement, and creating a solid base of active holders.
