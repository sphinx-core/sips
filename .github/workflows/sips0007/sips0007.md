## Overview

The **[SPX denominations](https://github.com/sphinx-core/go/tree/main/src/params/denom)** package provides constants that define the denominations for the SPX token within the Sphinx blockchain. These denominations help represent different units of SPX, allowing developers to work with both the smallest unit (nSPX) and larger, more human-readable units (gSPX and SPX).

The SPX token employs a hierarchical structure similar to other blockchain tokens like Ethereum's wei or Bitcoin's satoshi. The smallest unit is nano SPX (nSPX), and larger denominations scale up based on powers of ten.


### Mathematical Representation
Let $𝑛𝑆𝑃𝑋$ represent the smallest unit of SPX. The relationships between denominations can be expressed mathematically as:

**Nano SPX (nSPX)**:

$$
1𝑛𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 10^0 𝑛𝑆𝑃𝑋
$$


**Giga SPX (gSPX)**

$$
1g𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 10^9 𝑛𝑆𝑃𝑋
$$

**SPX (1 SPX)**

$$
1𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 10^18 𝑛𝑆𝑃𝑋
$$

## Conversion

**1. Convert SPX to nSPX:**

$$
1𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 10^18 𝑛𝑆𝑃𝑋
$$

Example: To represent 2 SPX in terms of nSPX:

$$
2𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 2 x 10^18 𝑛𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 2,000,000,000,000,000,000nSPX
$$

**2. Convert gSPX to nSPX:**

$$
1g𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 10^9 𝑛𝑆𝑃𝑋
$$

Example: To represent 500 gSPX in terms of nSPX:

$$
500g𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 500 x 10^9 𝑛𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 500,000,000,000nSPX
$$

**3. Convert SPX to gSPX:**

$$
1𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 10^9 g𝑆𝑃𝑋
$$


Example: To represent 1.5 SPX in terms of gSPX:

$$
1.5𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 1.5 x 10^9 g𝑆𝑃𝑋 = 1,500,000,000gSPX
$$


## Denomination usecase

**1.Smart Contract Calculations:**

When performing on-chain transactions or calculations, always use nSPX as the base unit to maintain precision and avoid rounding errors.

**2. Token Transfers:**

Use gSPX or SPX for user-facing applications to simplify readability. Internally, convert these to nSPX for compatibility with the Sphinx blockchain.

**3. Decimal Handling in Applications:**

When building wallet interfaces, display amounts in SPX or gSPX but ensure conversions to and from nSPX are accurate.
