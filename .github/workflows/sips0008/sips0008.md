## Overview
A multi-party signature (also known as multisig) is a cryptographic method where multiple participants are required to sign a message or transaction before it is considered valid. This ensures that no single participant has full control over the decision, and it enhances security by preventing fraud.

In a multisig system, there is a concept of a quorum, which represents the minimum number of signatures required for the transaction to be valid. The idea is that a message or transaction can only proceed if enough participants—typically more than half or a predefined number—agree by signing it.

For example, if the quorum is set to 3 out of 5 participants, at least 3 signatures are required for the transaction to be approved.

Mathematically, a multisig signature is represented as:

$$
SIG = t(n_1, ..., n_t)
$$

Where:

$$
t$$ 

is the function that combines the signatures. and 

$$
n_1, ..., n_t
$$ 

are the individual signatures from participants (up to $t$ signatures, where $t$ is the quorum).

## Key Components

### MultisigManager: 

This is the core of the package. It manages the cryptographic keys, signature generation, and verification process for all participants. It also ensures that signatures are collected from the required number of parties to form a valid multisignature.

**The key attributes include:**

* KeyManager `(km)`: Manages the cryptographic keys for the participants.
* SphincsManager `(manager)`: Handles the signing and verification of messages using SPHINCS+.
* Quorum `(quorum)`: The minimum number of signatures required for validity.
* Signatures `(signatures)`: Maps party IDs to their corresponding signatures.
* Public Keys `(partyPK)`: Maps party IDs to their public keys.
* Proofs `(proofs)`: Maps party IDs to their respective cryptographic proofs for signature validation.

**Functions:**

* Key Management: The package allows for key pair generation, public key management, and key serialization/deserialization.
* Signature Management: Each participant can sign a message, and the signatures are then collected in a thread-safe manner.
* Signature Verification: After gathering signatures, the package checks if enough signatures meet the quorum and verifies their validity.
* Proof Generation: A proof is generated for each signature to ensure its integrity and provide an audit trail.
* Recovery: In case a participant needs to recover their wallet, the package enables recovery by verifying the signatures and proofs from other participants.

### Solution to Large Signature Problem in PQC

### Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Challenges and Our Solution

One of the main challenges with Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) is that they have super large size of their signatures, which can lead to significant **storage** and **bandwidth** issues. The large signatures required in PQC schemes can become cumbersome, especially when dealing with a large number of participants or in systems with limited resources. 

To address these challenges, we refer to the implementation of the **[HashTree-Signature-Scheme](https://github.com/sphinx-core/sips/wiki/SIPS0002)**, which is specifically designed to manage large signatures efficiently.

- **Signature Compression:** By structuring the signature into a Merkle tree, we can compress the signature into a smaller digest. This compression reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and transmitted, mitigating storage and bandwidth concerns.
  
- **Efficient Verification:** The root of the Merkle tree serves as a compact representation of the entire signature. Only the Merkle root and a few additional hashes are required for verification. This approach allows for much efficient verification processes without the need to transmitted the entire of large signature.


**The notation define as:**

$$
SIG = t(proof_1, ..., proof_t)
$$

Where: $t$ is the function that combines the signatures. and $proof_1, ..., proof_t$ are the individual signatures from participants (up to $t$ signatures, where $t$ is the quorum).


**Steps:**

* Lock Resources: Prevent concurrent modifications by locking the mutex.
* Deserialize Private Key: Extract the private key from its serialized format.
* Generate Signature and Merkle Root:

**Compute the SPHINCS+ signature $𝜎$.**

* Derive the corresponding Merkle root $𝑅$ from the signature.
* Serialize and Store Signature: Convert $𝜎$ into a byte array and associate it with the party.
* Generate Proof: Use the message and Merkle root to create a proof $proof_𝑖$ for the signature.
* Return Results: Output the signature $𝜎$ and Merkle root $𝑅$ for further use.

**Notation**

For a message $𝑚$, the signing process generates:

* A signature $𝜎$,
* A Merkle root $𝑅$, and
* A proof $proof_𝑖$ for party $𝑖$

$$
Sig(m,privKey_i)→(σ_i,R,proof_i)
$$

T**he overall collection of signatures and proofs for $𝑡$ participants is:**

$$
Σ={(σ_1,proof_1),(σ_2,proof_2),…,(σ_t,proof_t)}
$$

**Where $Σ$ is stored such that:**

$$
SIG=t(proof_1,…,proof_t)
$$


### 2. VerifySignatures

**Description**
This method checks whether the collected signatures are valid and meet the required quorum. A signature is valid if:

* It is correctly signed using the party's private key.
* The signature corresponds to the provided Merkle root.

**Steps:**

* **Lock Resources:** Prevent concurrent reads during verification.
* **Check Quorum:** Ensure enough signatures $(𝑡≥ quorum)$ are collected.
* **Validate Each Signature:**
1. Deserialize the participant's public key and signature.

2. Verify the signature against the Merkle root and message.

* **Count Valid Signatures:** Increment the counter for each valid signature.
* **Return Result:**

1. Pass if valid signatures meet the quorum.

2. Fail if quorum requirements are unmet.


**Notation**

Given a message $\( m \)$, a quorum $\( q \)$, and a set of collected signatures $\( \Sigma \)$:

**let $\( v_i \)$ represent the validity of $\( \sigma_i \)$:** 

$$
\[
v_i = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \sigma_i \text{ is valid for } m \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
$$

**The total number of valid signatures is:**

$$
\[
V = \sum_{i=1}^{t} v_i
\]
$$

**The signatures are valid if:**

$$
\[
V \geq q
\]
$$

If valid, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.


## Key Recovery

This process enables the recovery of a multi-signature wallet by collecting signatures and proofs from the required participants. It ensures that only authorized participants, who possess the necessary passkeys and proofs, can recover the wallet. The recovery requires a quorum of valid signatures to proceed.

The process is composed of several key steps, starting from verifying the user's identity (passphrase and passkey), to ensuring that enough valid signatures have been gathered from participants. Once these conditions are met, the system generates a recovery proof, which can be used to recover the wallet.

### Steps Overview

* **Verify Fingerprint:** The user's fingerprint is validated using the provided passkey and passphrase. This step ensures that only the authorized user can initiate the recovery.

* **Decode Passkey:** The passkey is decoded from base32 encoding, which is necessary for further verification.

* **Verify MacKey and ChainCode:** The passkey is verified to match the expected MacKey and ChainCode stored in memory. This ensures that the key used for recovery is valid.

* **Verify Chain Code:** The system regenerates the chain code using the decoded passkey and verifies it against the stored chain code to confirm its validity.

* **Initialize MultisigManager:** A MultisigManager is initialized with a quorum value, specifying the minimum number of valid signatures required for the wallet recovery.

* **Collect Signatures and Proofs:** The system collects signatures and proofs from the participants required for recovery. Each participant's signature and proof are validated to ensure authenticity.

* **Quorum Check:** The system checks whether the number of valid signatures meets the quorum requirement. If not, the recovery process fails.

* **Return Recovery Proof:** If enough valid signatures have been collected, the recovery proof (a combination of the signatures and proofs) is returned, completing the wallet recovery.


### Notation

The mathematical representation of the recovery process can be described as follows:

**Let:**
- $\( m \)$ be the message that requires signatures.
- $\( \Sigma = \{\sigma_1, \sigma_2, \dots, \sigma_t\} \)$ be the set of collected signatures from participants.
- $\( v_i \)$ represent the validity of each signature $\( \sigma_i \)$.

**The validity of each signature is defined as:**

$$
\[
v_i = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \sigma_i \text{ is valid for } m \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
$$

**The total number of valid signatures is the sum of valid signatures:**

$$
\[
V = \sum_{i=1}^{t} v_i
\]
$$

**The signatures are considered valid if the total number of valid signatures is greater than or equal to the quorum $$\( q \)$$:**

$$
\[
V \geq q
\]
$$

If the total number of valid signatures meets or exceeds the quorum, the recovery process returns the recovery proof, which can be used to recover the wallet. Otherwise, it returns an error indicating that the quorum has not been met.
