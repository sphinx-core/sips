## Overview
A multi-party signature (also known as multisig) is a cryptographic method where multiple participants are required to sign a message or transaction before it is considered valid. This ensures that no single participant has full control over the decision, and it enhances security by preventing fraud.

In a multisig system, there is a concept of a quorum, which represents the minimum number of signatures required for the transaction to be valid. The idea is that a message or transaction can only proceed if enough participants—typically more than half or a predefined number—agree by signing it.

For example, if the quorum is set to 3 out of 5 participants, at least 3 signatures are required for the transaction to be approved.

Mathematically, a multisig signature is represented as:

$$
SIG = t(n_1, ..., n_t)
$$

Where:

$$
t$$ 

is the function that combines the signatures. and 

$$
n_1, ..., n_t
$$ 

are the individual signatures from participants (up to t signatures, where t is the quorum).
This approach is often used in environments that require heightened security, such as cryptocurrency wallets, organizational decision-making, and secure communications.

### Key Components of the Package

MultisigManager: 

This is the core of the package. It manages the cryptographic keys, signature generation, and verification process for all participants. It also ensures that signatures are collected from the required number of parties to form a valid multisignature.

**The key attributes include:**

* KeyManager `(km)`: Manages the cryptographic keys for the participants.
* SphincsManager `(manager)`: Handles the signing and verification of messages using SPHINCS+.
* Quorum `(quorum)`: The minimum number of signatures required for validity.
* Signatures `(signatures)`: Maps party IDs to their corresponding signatures.
* Public Keys `(partyPK)`: Maps party IDs to their public keys.
* Proofs `(proofs)`: Maps party IDs to their respective cryptographic proofs for signature validation.

**Functions:**

* Key Management: The package allows for key pair generation, public key management, and key serialization/deserialization.
* Signature Management: Each participant can sign a message, and the signatures are then collected in a thread-safe manner.
* Signature Verification: After gathering signatures, the package checks if enough signatures meet the quorum and verifies their validity.
* Proof Generation: A proof is generated for each signature to ensure its integrity and provide an audit trail.
* Recovery: In case a participant needs to recover their wallet, the package enables recovery by verifying the signatures and proofs from other participants.
