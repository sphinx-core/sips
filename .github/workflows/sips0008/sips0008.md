## Overview
A multi-party signature (also known as multisig) is a cryptographic method where multiple participants are required to sign a message or transaction before it is considered valid. This ensures that no single participant has full control over the decision, and it enhances security by preventing fraud.

In a multisig system, there is a concept of a quorum, which represents the minimum number of signatures required for the transaction to be valid. The idea is that a message or transaction can only proceed if enough participants—typically more than half or a predefined number—agree by signing it.

For example, if the quorum is set to 3 out of 5 participants, at least 3 signatures are required for the transaction to be approved.

Mathematically, a multisig signature is represented as:

$$
SIG = t(n_1, ..., n_t)
$$

Where:

$$
t$$ 

is the function that combines the signatures. and 

$$
n_1, ..., n_t
$$ 

are the individual signatures from participants (up to $t$ signatures, where $t$ is the quorum).

## Key Components

### MultisigManager: 

This is the core of the package. It manages the cryptographic keys, signature generation, and verification process for all participants. It also ensures that signatures are collected from the required number of parties to form a valid multisignature.

**The key attributes include:**

* KeyManager `(km)`: Manages the cryptographic keys for the participants.
* SphincsManager `(manager)`: Handles the signing and verification of messages using SPHINCS+.
* Quorum `(quorum)`: The minimum number of signatures required for validity.
* Signatures `(signatures)`: Maps party IDs to their corresponding signatures.
* Public Keys `(partyPK)`: Maps party IDs to their public keys.
* Proofs `(proofs)`: Maps party IDs to their respective cryptographic proofs for signature validation.

**Functions:**

* Key Management: The package allows for key pair generation, public key management, and key serialization/deserialization.
* Signature Management: Each participant can sign a message, and the signatures are then collected in a thread-safe manner.
* Signature Verification: After gathering signatures, the package checks if enough signatures meet the quorum and verifies their validity.
* Proof Generation: A proof is generated for each signature to ensure its integrity and provide an audit trail.
* Recovery: In case a participant needs to recover their wallet, the package enables recovery by verifying the signatures and proofs from other participants.

## Workflow

### 1. SignMessage

**Description**
As we refer the implementation of **[HashTree-Signature-Scheme](https://github.com/sphinx-core/sips/wiki/SIPS0002)** that they are employed to manage large signatures.

* **Signature Compression:** By structuring the signature into a Merkle tree, it is possible to compress the signature into a smaller digest. This compression reduces the amount of data that needs to be stored and transmitted.

* **Efficient Verification:** The root of the Hash tree serves as a compact representation of the entire signature. This allows for quicker verification processes, as only the Merkle root and a few additional hashes are necessary to confirm the validity of the signature without needing to handle the entire signature.

**The notation define as:**

$$
SIG = t(proof_1, ..., proof_t)
$$

Where: $t$ is the function that combines the signatures. and $proof_1, ..., proof_t$ are the individual signatures from participants (up to $t$ signatures, where $t$ is the quorum).


**Steps:**

* Lock Resources: Prevent concurrent modifications by locking the mutex.
* Deserialize Private Key: Extract the private key from its serialized format.
* Generate Signature and Merkle Root:

**Compute the SPHINCS+ signature $𝜎$.**

* Derive the corresponding Merkle root $𝑅$ from the signature.
* Serialize and Store Signature: Convert $𝜎$ into a byte array and associate it with the party.
* Generate Proof: Use the message and Merkle root to create a proof $proof_𝑖$ for the signature.
* Return Results: Output the signature $𝜎$ and Merkle root $𝑅$ for further use.

**Notation**

For a message $𝑚$, the signing process generates:

* A signature $𝜎$,
* A Merkle root $𝑅$, and
* A proof $proof_𝑖$ for party $𝑖$

$$
Sig(m,privKey_i)→(σ_i,R,proof_i)
$$

The overall collection of signatures and proofs for $𝑡$ participants is:

$$
Σ={(σ_1,proof_1),(σ_2,proof_2),…,(σ_t,proof_t)}
$$

Where $Σ$ is stored such that:

$$
SIG=t(proof_1,…,proof_t)
$$


### 2. VerifySignatures

**Description**
This method checks whether the collected signatures are valid and meet the required quorum. A signature is valid if:

* It is correctly signed using the party's private key.
* The signature corresponds to the provided Merkle root.

**Steps:**

* **Lock Resources:** Prevent concurrent reads during verification.
* **Check Quorum:** Ensure enough signatures $(𝑡≥ quorum)$ are collected.
* **Validate Each Signature:**
1. Deserialize the participant's public key and signature.

2. Verify the signature against the Merkle root and message.

* **Count Valid Signatures:** Increment the counter for each valid signature.
* **Return Result:**

1. Pass if valid signatures meet the quorum.

2. Fail if quorum requirements are unmet.


**Notation**

Given a message $\( m \)$, a quorum $\( q \)$, and a set of collected signatures $\( \Sigma \)$:

* let $\( v_i \)$ represent the validity of $\( \sigma_i \)$: 

$$
\[
v_i = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } \sigma_i \text{ is valid for } m \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]
$$

* The total number of valid signatures is:

$$
\[
V = \sum_{i=1}^{t} v_i
\]
$$

* The signatures are valid if:

$$
\[
V \geq q
\]
$$

* If valid, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.
