## Overview

This documentation describes the process of generating a passphrase, passkey, and hashed passkey, which are used for secure user login implementation in [accounts](https://github.com/sphinx-core/go/tree/main/src/accounts/phrase). The key generation aims to defend against quantum-computer factoring attacks, particularly for scenarios involving large wordlists (2048 words).

## Key Points

**The Need for a Double Password Approach**

To mitigate the risks posed by quantum computing, a "double password" approach is becoming essential. This approach combines two layers of security:

* Passphrase Protection: A passphrase should be long and cryptographically secure, designed to provide protection against quantum-enabled attacks. In the age of quantum computing, a passphrase should ideally have $2048^12$ protection, meaning it should be derived from a vast amount of entropy, making it virtually impossible for quantum computers to brute-force in any reasonable amount of time.

* Passkey Enhancement: Alongside the passphrase, a passkey should be introduced as an additional security layer. This passkey is not derived from the passphrase but serves as a secondary factor that further strengthens the system. The passkey should be designed to be exponentially large, providing an additional barrier.

**Double Layer Security:**

What sets this approach apart is that an attacker would need to guess both the passphrase and the passkey correctly. Attackers are **not allowed** to guess just one of these keys; both must be compromised to gain access. These two keys—one derived from an immense amount of entropy and the other providing an astronomical number of possibilities—ensure that even with quantum computing power, it is practically impossible for attackers to gain access. This dual-layer security mitigates the risk of compromising a single key and strengthens the system's defense against both current and future computational threats.

## Notation for the Approach

**Passphrase Protection**: A passphrase with 
> $2048^12$ protection 

implies that the space of possible passphrases is so vast that even quantum computers with their ability to parallelize computations would require an impractical amount of time and resources to crack. For further improvement, we continue to expand the wordlist to provide even higher possibilities, further enhancing security.

**Passkey Entropy**: The second layer, the passkey, providing 

> $2^4199040×8 = 2^33592320$ possibilities

ensures that the system is so securely protected that any attempt to guess the passkey through brute force would exceed the computational limits of any current or foreseeable quantum computer.

**Entropy Calculation:**
Total number of possibilities: If a passkey consists of $4199040-bytes$, and each byte has 256 possible values (since one byte = $8-bits$, and each bit can be either $0$ or $1$), then the total number of possible passkeys is:

> $2^4199040×8 = 2^33592320$ possibilities

Entropy in bits: The entropy of the passkey is exactly equal to the logarithm $base2$ of the total number of possibilities. Since the passkey space has $2^33592320$ possibilities, the entropy of the passkey is $33592320-bits$. It would actually provide $33592320-bits$ of entropy (or approximately $3.36 x 10^7 bits$).
