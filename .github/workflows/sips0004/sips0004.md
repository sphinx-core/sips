## Overview

This documentation describes the process of generating a passphrase, passkey, and hashed passkey, which are used for secure user login implementation in [accounts](https://github.com/sphinx-core/go/tree/main/src/accounts/phrase). The key generation aims to defend against quantum-computer factoring attacks, particularly for scenarios involving large wordlists (2048 words). This system uses entropy generation, cryptographic hashing techniques, and key derivation functions to ensure the security and robustness of the generated keys.

## Motivation

**1. Implications for Passphrase Protection:**

A passphrase based on a wordlist (like a 2048-word passphrase), Shor's algorithm wouldn't directly impact this, since it's not a public-key cryptosystem. However, the strength of a passphrase is typically dependent on its length and entropy. For instance, a 2048-word passphrase would have 2048 × $log_2$(2048) bits of entropy, which is quite strong against classical brute-force attacks, but could potentially be vulnerable to quantum computing techniques such as Grover's algorithm.

**2. Grover's Algorithm and Passphrase Cracking:**

Grover's algorithm is another quantum algorithm that provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, such as brute-forcing a passphrase. For a passphrase with 𝑛 bits of entropy, Grover's algorithm would reduce the time complexity of a brute-force search from 
$2^𝑛$ to $2^𝑛/2$. So, while a 2048-word passphrase might be very strong against classical brute-forcing, Grover’s algorithm could reduce the effort required to crack it to approximately $2^1024$, which is still computationally hard but more feasible than a classical brute-force attack.

**3. BHT Algorithm (Brassard–Høyer–Tapp)**

Further improvement might come from the Brassard–Høyer–Tapp (BHT) algorithm, which is another quantum algorithm designed to solve certain search problems more efficiently. The BHT algorithm operates in $𝑂(2^𝑛/3)$ time, where $𝑛$ is the number of bits of entropy in the passphrase. For a passphrase with the same 22528 bits of entropy, the BHT algorithm could potentially reduce the time complexity to approximately 
$2^22528/3$, making it a more efficient approach than Grover’s algorithm for certain cases. The use of quantum Random Access Memory (qRAM) could further improve this, making the attack even faster.


**4. Design to Prevent against Grover's Alhorithm:**

* Passphrase + Passkey Combination: By using both a passphrase and a passkey, the system creates a more complex security landscape for any attacker, including one using Grover's algorithm. The attacker would need to search both the passphrase space and the passkey space, making it exponentially more difficult to crack.

* Double Sphinx Hashing: The use of double hashing (Sphinx hash applied twice) before passing the key material to Argon2 further strengthens the system by adding multiple layers of cryptographic transformations. This process exponentially increases the difficulty of an attack, especially in the presence of quantum algorithms.

* Salt and Nonce: The generation of random salts and nonces during the passkey generation process adds additional unpredictability, further increasing the security of the derived passkey.

The double-key approach (passphrase + passkey), combined with strong cryptographic techniques (e.g., Argon2 hashing, Sphinx double hashing, salt and nonce generation), significantly mitigates the impact of Grover’s algorithm. While Grover’s algorithm would still provide a quadratic speedup for brute-forcing, this design makes it computationally infeasible to crack the passphrase and passkey combination in a reasonable amount of time, even with quantum computational resources.

func main() {
	// Step 1: Generate the keys (passphrase, Base32-encoded passkey, fingerprint, chain code, and macKey)
	passphrase, base32Passkey, _, macKey, chainCode, fingerprint, err := seed.GenerateKeys()
	if err != nil {
		// Log the error and terminate the program if key generation fails
		log.Fatalf("Error generating keys: %v", err)
	}

	// Step 2: Display the generated keys for debugging or information purposes
	fmt.Println("Passphrase: ", passphrase)            // Display the original mnemonic phrase
	fmt.Println("Passkey: ", base32Passkey)            // Display the Base32-encoded passkey
	fmt.Printf("MacKey: %x\n", macKey)                 // Display the fingerprint in hexadecimal format
	fmt.Printf("Chain code (Mackey): %x\n", chainCode) // Display the Chain code in hexadecimal format
	fmt.Printf("Fingerprint: %x\n", fingerprint)       // Display the hmac key in hexadecimal format

	// Step 3: Verify the Base32 passkey
	// Now using the `VerifyBase32Passkey` function from `utils`, which no longer generates a root hash.
	isValidmacKey, _, _, err := utils.VerifyBase32Passkey(base32Passkey)
	if err != nil {
		// If verification fails, print an error message
		fmt.Printf("Verification failed: %v\n", err)
	} else {
		// If verification succeeds, display the results
		fmt.Printf("Verification macKey result: %t\n", isValidmacKey) // Indicate whether the passkey is valid
	}

	// Step 4: Verify the fingerprint
	isValidFingerprint, err := auth.VerifyFingerPrint(base32Passkey, passphrase)
	if err != nil {
		// If verification fails, print an error message
		fmt.Printf("Fingerprint verification failed: %v\n", err)
	} else if isValidFingerprint {
		// If the fingerprint verification succeeds, display the result
		fmt.Printf("Verification fingerprint result: %t\n", isValidFingerprint)
	} else {

		fmt.Println("Fingerprint did not match!")
	}

**Step 1: Generate Entropy for Mnemonic**

* Function: GenerateEntropy()
* Purpose: Generate a random sequence of bits used for passphrase generation.
* Let $𝐸$ represent the entropy:

$$
𝐸=GenerateEntropy()
$$ 

Where $𝐸$ is a random bit string used for further steps. If there is an error, return $∅$.


**Step 2: Derive Passphrase**
* Function: GeneratePassphrase(entropy)
* Purpose: Derive the passphrase from the entropy $𝐸$
Let 𝑃 represent the passphrase derived from entropy:

$$
𝑃 = GeneratePassphrase(𝐸)
$$

If there's an error in generating the passphrase, return $∅$.


**Step 3: Generate Passkey from Passphrase**
* Function: GeneratePasskey(passphrase)
* Purpose: Derive a passkey $𝐾$ from the passphrase , usually through a key derivation process.
Let $𝐾$ represent the passkey derived from the passphrase:

$$
𝐾 = GeneratePasskey(𝑃)
$$

If there's an error, return $∅$.

**Step 4: Hash the Passkey**
* Function: HashPasskey(passkey)
* Purpose: Hash the passkey using the SHA3-512 hashing algorithm to create a fixed-length hash value $𝐻$.
Let $𝐻$ be the hashed passkey:

$$
𝐻 = H^512(𝐾)
$$

Where $𝐻$ is the 512-bit hash. If an error occurs, return $∅$.


**Step 5: Select Hash Parts**
* Purpose: Use the entire hash $𝐻$ as selected material for further steps.
Let the selected parts of $𝐻$ be:

$$
𝑆 = 𝐻
$$


**Step 6: Generate Nonce**
* Purpose: Generate a nonce $𝑁$ which is a random 16-byte value.
Let $𝑁$ represent the nonce:

$$
𝑁 = GenerateNonce(16)
$$


**Step 7: Combine Selected Parts and Nonce**
* Purpose: Combine the selected parts $𝑆$ and nonce $𝑁$ into a new dataset.
Let $𝐶$ represent the combined parts:

$$
𝐶 = 𝑆 ∥ 𝑁
$$

Where ∥ denotes concatenation.


**Step 8: Create Salt**
* Purpose: Combine a predefined string with the first 64 bytes of the hashed passkey $𝐻$ to create a salt $𝜎$.
Let $𝜎$ represent the salt:

$$
𝜎 ="Base32Passkey"∥𝐻
$$


**Step 9: Apply Sponge Construction (SHA-3)**
* Purpose: Use SHA-3-256 to apply the sponge construction over multiple rounds. This involves absorbing and squeezing operations to generate new data.
Let $𝑇$ represent the transformed parts:

$$
𝑇 = SpongeOperation(𝐶,𝜎,iterations)
$$

Where the sponge operation mixes the combined data over multiple iterations. After each iteration, the state is transformed and squeezed to produce new data. The resulting transformed parts are stored in 𝑇.

**Step 10: Select Random Output Length**
* Purpose: Select a random output length between 6 and 8 bytes. This length determines how many bytes will be chosen from the combined dataset $𝑇$.
Let $𝐿$ represent the random output length:

$$
𝐿 ∈{6,7,8}
$$

Select $𝐿$ bytes from $𝑇$ to form the final output.


**Step 11: Encode in Base32**
* Purpose: Base32 encode the selected output data to convert the binary data into a human-readable format.
Let the Base32-encoded string $𝐵$ be:

$$
𝐵 = Base32Encode(𝑇)
$$


**Step 12: Generate MacKey and ChainCode**
* Function: utils.GenerateMacKey(combinedParts, hashedPasskey)
* Purpose: Generate a macKey and chainCode, which are used to validate the data.
Let $𝑀$ represent the macKey and $𝐶_𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛$ the chainCode:

$$
𝑀,𝐶_𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑖𝑛 = GenerateMacKey(𝑇,𝐻)
$$


**Step 13: Generate Fingerprint**
* Function: auth.GenerateChainCode(passphrase, combinedParts)
* Purpose: Generate a fingerprint by combining the passphrase $𝑃$ and transformed parts $𝑇$.
Let $𝐹$ represent the fingerprint:

$$
𝐹 = GenerateChainCode(𝑃,𝑇)
$$
